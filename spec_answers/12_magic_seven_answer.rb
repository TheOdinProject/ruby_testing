# The file order to complete this lesson:
# 1. Familarize yourself with the class in lib/12_magic_seven.rb
# 2. Complete spec/12_magic_seven_spec.rb

# Before learning any more complexities of testing, let's take a look at a
# standard testing pattern: Arrange, Act, and Assert.
# https://youtu.be/sCthIEOaMI8

# 1. Arrange -> set up the test (examples: initializing objects, let
#               variables, updating values of instance variables).
# 2. Act ->     execute the logic to test (example: calling a method to run).
# 3. Assert ->  expect the results of arrange & act.

# The tests in this lesson are fairly easy to understand, and it may seem
# ridiculous to use A-A-A for them. However, tests should be easily understood
# not just by you, but also by someone that is not familiar with the code.

# NOTE: When you start using A-A-A to format your tests, it will feel
# strange to not be following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). With tests, however,
# repetition is necessary in order for them to be easy to read. If you are using
# rubocop, you can disable specific (or all) cops for certain files (or
# directories) by adding a .rubocop.yml file.
# https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/0.88/configuration.html#includingexcluding-files

# When you start working on a existing code base, you will often become familiar
# with the code by reading the tests.

    # This test could be written as below (and it would pass):
    it 'returns 15' do
      expect(game.add_nine(6)).to eq(15)
    end

    # However, the above test is NOT very readable. For example, it does not
    # explain where '6' came from. So let's start with explaining
    # where '6' came from, as part of the 'Arrange' step.

      # For the 'Assert' step, we know exactly we expect the result to be:
      expect(result).to eq(15)
