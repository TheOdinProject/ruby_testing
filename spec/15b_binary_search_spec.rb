# The file order to complete this lesson:

# 1. Familarize yourself with the three lib/15 files.
#    - lib/15a_binary_game
#    - lib/15b_binary_search which is based on 14_find_number
#    - lib/15c_random_number
# 2. Look at spec/15b_binary_search_spec which is based on 14_find_number_spec
# 3. Complete spec/15a_binary_game_spec

# This spec file is for the BinarySearch class that is used in the BinaryGame
# class. These tests were written in the last lesson. The FindNumber class
# has been renamed to BinarySearch, which is a more accurate description.

# This spec file uses verifying doubles to help you get acquaintance with the
# concept. Differently from the normal test double we've been using so far,
# a verifying double can produce an error if the method being stubbed does not
# exist in the actual class. Verifying doubles are a great tool to use when
# you're doing integration testing and need to make sure that different classes
# work together in order to fulfill some bigger computation.
# https://rspec.info/features/3-12/rspec-mocks/verifying-doubles/

# You should not use verifying doubles for unit testings. Unit testing relies
# on using doubles to test the object in isolation (i.e., not dependent on any
# other object). One important concept to understand is that the BinarySearch
# or FindNumber class doesn't care if it is given an actual random_number class
# object. It only cares that it is given an object that can respond to certain
# methods. This concept is called polymorphism.
