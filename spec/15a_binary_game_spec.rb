# The file order to complete this lesson:

# 1. Familarize yourself with the four lib/15 files.
#    - lib/15_binary_main
#    - lib/15a_binary_game
#    - lib/15b_binary_search which is based on 14_find_number
#    - lib/15c_random_number
# 2. Read the comments in spec/15b_binary_search_spec
# 3. Complete spec/15a_binary_game_spec

# As noted above, the files for this lesson (#15) build on the TDD files
# from #14. The FindNumber class is now called BinarySearch, which is a more
# accurate description.

# This lesson has a new class called BinaryGame. This BinaryGame class uses
# the BinarySearch class and visualizes how a binary search works.

# The focus of this lesson is unit testing, which is testing the behavior of
# individual methods in isolation. However, every method does not need to be
# tested, so we will look at some basic guidelines that determine whether or not
# a method needs to be tested.
# https://www.artofunittesting.com/definition-of-a-unit-test

# In general, you probably have 4 different types of methods:
# 1. Command - Changes the observable state, but does not return a value.
# 2. Query - Returns a result, but does not change the observable state.
# 3. Script - Only calls other methods, usually without returning anything.
# 4. Looping Script - Only calls other methods, usually without returning
#    anything, and stops when certain conditions are met.

# Let's take a look at methods that should always be tested:

# 1. Public Command or Public Query Methods should always be tested, because
# they are the public interface. Command Methods should test the method's action
# or side effect. Query Methods should test the method's return value.

# 2. Command or Query Methods that are inside a public script or looping script
# method should be tested. For the games that we are making, script and looping
# script methods are just a convenient way to call the methods needed to play a
# full game. Since these methods are required to play the game, they should be
# tested and made public (even if you previously made them private). Pretend
# that someone will be using your class to make their own game with customized
# text. Any method that they would need in their game should be part of the
# public interface and have test coverage.

# 3. Any method that sends a command message to another class should always test
# that those messages were sent.

# 4. A Looping Script Method should test the behavior of the method. For
# example, that it stops when certain conditions are met.

# Here is a summary of what should be tested
# 1. Command Method -> Test the change in the observable state
# 2. Query Method -> Test the return value
# 3. Method with Outgoing Command -> Test that a message is sent
# 4. Looping Script Method -> Test the behavior of the method

# There are a handful of methods that you do not need to test:

# 1. You do not have to test #initialize if it is only creating instance
# variables. However, if you call methods inside the initialize method, you
# might need to test #initialize and/or the inside methods. In addition, you
# will need to stub any inside methods because they will be called when you
# create an instance of the class.

# 2. You do not have to test methods that only contain 'puts' or 'gets' 
# because they are well-tested in the standard Ruby library.

# 3. Private methods do not need to be tested because they should have test
# coverage in public methods. However, as previously discussed, you may have
# some private methods that are called inside a script or looping script method;
# these methods should be tested publicly.

# Open the file lib/15a_binary_game in a split screen, so you can see both
# files at the same time. We will look at every method and determine if it will
# need to be tested or not.

    # for @value, we could update @random_number's value inside the BinaryGame
    # class. For example: @random_number.value = number_input

    # However, this breaks the encapsulation of the RandomNumber class. As a
    # general rule, you want to minimize what classes know about other classes.
    # You should not let BinaryGame update the value of a RandomNumber. Instead,
    # you want BinaryGame to just send a message to RandomNumber telling it to

      # being stubbed do not exist in the actual class. Verifying doubles are a 
      # great tool to use when you're doing integration testing and need to make

      # You should not use verifying doubles for unit testings. Unit testing relies 
      # on using doubles to test the object in isolation (i.e., not dependent on any
      # other object). One important concept to understand is that the BinarySearch 
      # or FindNumber class doesn't care if it is given an actual random_number class
      # object. It only cares that it is given an object that can respond to certain 
      # methods. This concept is called polymorphism.
